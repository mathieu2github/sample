My solution is quite straightforward.

I assumed one wont put integer m into a n x n grid, if (m > n). But new verison of my code pre check the range of the number in 
Sudoku and if out of range, then return false without entering any follow checking process.


I check the row, then column then blocks iteratively.

By check I mean by checking the n numbers within one row/column/block can reverse every value of a boolean array of size of n.

Only method validSudoku() is made as public and others are all private.

Put the test files, say, sampleInput.txt, in the package folder and also the args[0] is src/validateSudoku/sampleInput

That's all.

Thanks for considering me as a candidate!

I am very much interested in joining your team!
